# mmteb-toolkit
Code and datasets for MMTEB (Multilingual MTEB), used in our Multilingual Representations in Embeddings Models blog post for MIT 6.S898. The repo includes code to run the tests on a Transformers model

To run MMTEB, use mmteb.py. Tasks are in tasks.py.
All datasets are hosted on the HuggingFace hub, at the names linked below, except for SciFact, which is local in the repo.

Huge thanks to the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb#leaderboard) authors, Niklas Muennighoff, Nouamane Tazi, Lo√Øc Magne and Nils Reimers.

Further thanks to [Conviction](https://www.conviction.com/) for supplying API credits.
